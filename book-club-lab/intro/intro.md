# Introduction
## About this Workshop
In this workshop, you will create an application that allows you and your friends to search for books and create personal libraries. You will use the [Google Books API](https://developers.google.com/books/docs/v1/using), which is a database that contains a large amount of data about a vast number of books. Google Books has an extensive API that you will access in this workshop to search for books, and get book details.

When individual users log into the app, the home page will display their own unique library. They can add books to their library by searching for a specific books of their choice. After adding books to their list, users can mark them as read, rate the book, and post reviews.

While the end result is a simple version of a books library application, you can continue to build it out far past what this workshop takes you through, using many of the same concepts you will learn.  There are also a lot of features in Oracle APEX that you can use to allow users to rate books they have watched, make comments on books, and more.

Estimated Workshop Time: 2 hours

*Note: This lab assumes you are using Oracle APEX 24.1.*
